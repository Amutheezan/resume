  Hi, I'm Amutheezan Sivagnanam.

  I’m a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Informatics at Penn State, where I build AI tools that help buses run on time, vehicles find the best routes, and ambulances reach people faster. 

  My work mixes deep reinforcement learning with classic optimization and lots of real-world data so the systems make smart decisions in seconds and keep costs down. Along the way I’ve published first-author papers at ICML, AAAI, and IJCAI, shared open-source code so others can build on my work, and teamed up with industry partners to turn research ideas into working prototypes.

          Lab: **Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab (AAILab)**

          Supervisor: Dr. Aron Laszka

          Duties:
          * Spearheaded research projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
          * Studied real-world decision-making problems and identified gaps in existing solution approaches.
          * Developed mathematical models and formulated problems to address these challenges.
          * Applied artificial intelligence–based solutions to tackle real-world problems and successfully deployed them in relevant industries.
          * Published research findings in top-tier AI conferences (ICML) and assisted preparing slides for presenting results at DOE and NSF meetings.
          * Developed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for proactive responder repositioning in emergency management, achieving response times 1000× faster while reducing operational delays.
          * Applied DRL to solve online vehicle routing with advance booking, enabling real-time confirmations within seconds.
            
          Research Projects:
          * Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchical Coordination for Emergency Responder Stationing (Published in **ICML-24**)

          * Applied AI-based solution approaches to real-world problems and successfully deployed them in relevant industries.
          * Published research findings in top-tier AI conferences (AAAI, IJCAI) and assisted preparing slides for presenting results at DOE and NSF meetings.
          * ntroduced heuristics that reduced annual energy costs by $140K for public transit agencies operating mixed fleets of buses.
          * Implemented a deep reinforcement learning approach that reduced operational costs by 20% by enabling online booking for traditionally offline Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs).
          * Collected and analyzed real-world data using Python to identify trends—such as changes in paratransit operations before and after COVID-19 and the impact of vulnerability reward programs.

          Research Projects:
          * Minimizing Energy Usage in Transit Agencies Operating with Mixed-Fleet of Vehicles (Published in **AAAI-21**)
          * Offline Vehicle Routing with Online Bookings (Published in **IJCAI-22**)
          * The Benefits of Vulnerability Discovery and Bug Bounty Programs (Presented in **WEIS-21**, Published in **WWW-23**)
