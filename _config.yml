  Hi, I’m Amutheezan Sivagnanam.
  
  I recently earned my Ph.D. in Informatics at Penn State, where I built AI tools that help buses run on time, vehicles find the best routes, and ambulances reach people faster.
  
  My research combines deep reinforcement learning with classic optimization and real-world data so that systems can make smart decisions in seconds while keeping costs down. 
  
  Along the way, I’ve published first-author papers at ICML, AAAI, and IJCAI, released open-source code for others to build on, and collaborated with industry partners to turn research ideas into working prototypes.
