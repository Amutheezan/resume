  Hi, I'm Amutheezan Sivagnanam.

  I’m a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Informatics at Penn State, where I build AI tools that help buses run on time, vehicles find the best routes, and ambulances reach people faster. 

  My work mixes deep reinforcement learning with classic optimization and lots of real-world data so the systems make smart decisions in seconds and keep costs down. Along the way I’ve published first-author papers at ICML, AAAI, and IJCAI, shared open-source code so others can build on my work, and teamed up with industry partners to turn research ideas into working prototypes.
